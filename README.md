# Video looper
A program that reverses a video and stitches it to the original so you can have the perfect gif (returns mp4)

## Program usage:
1. Install python. 
2. Run the python file
3. see result in the file's path with the name originalName_result.mp4 (assuming originalName.mp4 is the name of the file you have provided)


## My usage:
I have used this program with obs studio's virtual camera plugin to fake my camera during online school classes.
tough the only issue I had was that when I talked, my lips didnt moved.
