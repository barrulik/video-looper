# Video looper
A program that makes the perfect video to loop

## Program usage:
just create a directory in the directory of the file named "images" (without the ""), then run the program, and type the prefared file's path.
it's result will simply be named (assumed the mp4 file is name test.mp4) test_result.mp4


## My usage:
I have used this program with obs studio's virtual camera plugin to fake my camera during online school classes.
tough the only issue I had was that when I talked, my lips didnt moved.
